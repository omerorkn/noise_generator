# noise_generator
LFSR Based Pseudo-Random Noise Generator

  - Engineer : omerorkn

My Working Environments (OS and IDE) :

  - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - Xilinx Vivado 2020.2 (Contains simulation and synthesis)

Module Features :

  - Data Width    : 5 (PARAMETRIC)
  - System Clock  : 100 MHz (PARAMETRIC)
  - Shift Freq    : 100 MHz (PARAMETRIC) -- for test

NOTE : By the way, If you would like to write all the noise data for create a line or histogram on excel, you can uncomment between line 94 - line 115 in "noise_gen_tb.vhd" and you can use textio library for create an output text file.

Best Regards.
